Denoising Telescopic Images using Tensor Flow and Noise2Void model

Description and Explanation for each line in the code :

```
# Install the tensorflow library suggested by N2V.
!pip install tensorflow
```

We're starting by installing the TensorFlow library, which is commonly used for deep learning tasks. The exclamation mark (!) before pip indicates that this line should be executed in the command line or terminal, not in the Python script or Jupyter Notebook.

```
# Install the tensorflow library suggested by N2V.
!pip install tensorflow
```
This line is a system command, and it's typically used in environments like Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab. It's a way to execute shell commands from within your Python environment.

Here's a breakdown:

pip is a package installer for Python.
install is a command for pip to install packages.
tensorflow is the package you want to install.
By running this command, you're ensuring that TensorFlow is installed in your environment, which is a prerequisite for many deep learning applications. If you encounter any issues at this stage, make sure you have a working internet connection, or consider using a virtual environment.

```
!pip install n2v
```

Installing a library called N2V using the pip package manager. N2V, or Noise2Void, is a deep learning-based method for image denoising.

```
!pip install n2v
```
Here's the breakdown:

pip is the package installer for Python.
install is a command for pip to install packages.
n2v is the package (Noise2Void) you're installing.
By running this command, you're installing the N2V package into your Python environment. N2V is likely to provide functions and tools specifically designed for the denoising task using deep learning techniques.

After executing this command, you should be able to use the functionalities provided by the N2V library in your code.

```
import tensorflow as tf
import n2v
print(tf.__version__)
print(n2v.__version__)
```
This part of the code is importing the TensorFlow library and the N2V library, then printing the versions of these libraries. Let's break it down:

```
import tensorflow as tf
import n2v
```
import tensorflow as tf: This line imports the TensorFlow library and assigns it the alias tf. It is a widely used open-source library for machine learning and deep learning. The alias tf is a common convention to make the code more readable.

import n2v: This line imports the N2V library. N2V, or Noise2Void, is a library that provides implementations for deep learning-based image denoising methods.

After these import statements, the code proceeds to print the versions of TensorFlow and N2V:

```
print(tf.__version__)
print(n2v.__version__)
```
print(tf.__version__): This line prints the version of TensorFlow installed in your environment. It can be useful to ensure that you are using the expected version of TensorFlow for compatibility with your code.

print(n2v.__version__): This line prints the version of the N2V library installed. Similar to TensorFlow, checking the library version can be important to ensure compatibility with your code.

By running these print statements, you can confirm which versions of TensorFlow and N2V you have installed. This can be crucial because different versions of libraries may have different features or behaviors.

```
# We import all our dependencies.
from n2v.models import N2VConfig, N2V
import numpy as np
from csbdeep.utils import plot_history
from n2v.utils.n2v_utils import manipulate_val_data
from n2v.internals.N2V_DataGenerator import N2V_DataGenerator
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import urllib
import os
import zipfile

import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
```

This section of your code is importing various modules and functions that you will use in your image denoising project. Let's break it down:

```
# We import all our dependencies.
from n2v.models import N2VConfig, N2V
import numpy as np
from csbdeep.utils import plot_history
from n2v.utils.n2v_utils import manipulate_val_data
from n2v.internals.N2V_DataGenerator import N2V_DataGenerator
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import urllib
import os
import zipfile

import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
```
Here's a breakdown of each import statement:

from n2v.models import N2VConfig, N2V: This imports specific classes (N2VConfig and N2V) from the n2v.models module. These classes are likely to be related to configuring and using the Noise2Void model.

import numpy as np: This imports the NumPy library and gives it the alias np. NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python and is often used for handling arrays and mathematical operations.

from csbdeep.utils import plot_history: This imports the plot_history function from the csbdeep.utils module. It is likely used for visualizing the training history of your model.

from n2v.utils.n2v_utils import manipulate_val_data: This imports the manipulate_val_data function from the n2v.utils.n2v_utils module. It may be used for manipulating validation data during the training process.

from n2v.internals.N2V_DataGenerator import N2V_DataGenerator: This imports the N2V_DataGenerator class from the n2v.internals.N2V_DataGenerator module. This class is likely responsible for generating data batches during training.

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt: This imports the pyplot module from the matplotlib library and gives it the alias plt. It is commonly used for creating visualizations, and you may use it to plot images or graphs.

import urllib: This imports the urllib module, which is often used for making HTTP requests. It can be used for downloading data or models.

import os: This imports the os module, which provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality, such as reading or writing files and directories.

import zipfile: This imports the zipfile module, which allows working with zip archives. It may be used for handling compressed files.

import ssl and setting SSL context: This is modifying the SSL context to create an unverified context. This is sometimes done to bypass SSL certificate verification during HTTPS requests. Be cautious when using this, as it can expose you to security risks.

These imports suggest that your code involves deep learning with the N2V model, data manipulation, visualization, and potentially downloading or handling data files.

```
# We create our DataGenerator-object.
# It will help us load data and extract patches for training and validation.
datagen = N2V_DataGenerator()
```
In this part of your code, you are creating an instance of the N2V_DataGenerator class and assigning it to the variable datagen. Let's break down this code snippet:

```
# We create our DataGenerator-object.
# It will help us load data and extract patches for training and validation.
datagen = N2V_DataGenerator()
```
Here's an explanation:

N2V_DataGenerator(): This line is creating an instance of the N2V_DataGenerator class. The N2V_DataGenerator class is likely designed to generate data batches for training and validation. It may include functionality to load data, extract patches, and perform other data augmentation tasks.

datagen = N2V_DataGenerator(): This line assigns the created instance of N2V_DataGenerator to the variable datagen. By doing this, you can use the datagen variable to access the methods and attributes of the N2V_DataGenerator class.

The use of a data generator is common in deep learning to efficiently handle large datasets by loading and processing them in smaller batches during training.

```
#METHOD 1: Loading images using load_imgs_from_directory method

# We load all the '.png' files from the directory.
# The function will return a list of images (numpy arrays).
imgs = datagen.load_imgs_from_directory(directory = "/content/drive/MyDrive/content/",
                                        filter='noisy*.png',dims='YXC')  #ZYX for 3D

# Let's look at the shape of the image
print('shape of loaded images: ',imgs[0].shape)

# If the image has four color channels (stored in the last dimension): RGB and Aplha.
# We are not interested in Alpha and will get rid of it.

imgs[0] = imgs[0][...,:3]
print('shape without alpha:    ',imgs[0].shape)
print('The data type of the first image is: ', imgs[0].dtype)
```

This section of your code is loading images from a specified directory using the load_imgs_from_directory method of your datagen object. Let's break it down:

```
# METHOD 1: Loading images using load_imgs_from_directory method

# We load all the '.png' files from the directory.
# The function will return a list of images (numpy arrays).
imgs = datagen.load_imgs_from_directory(directory="/content/drive/MyDrive/content/",
                                        filter='noisy*.png', dims='YXC')  # ZYX for 3D

# Let's look at the shape of the image
print('shape of loaded images: ', imgs[0].shape)

# If the image has four color channels (stored in the last dimension): RGB and Alpha.
# We are not interested in Alpha and will get rid of it.
imgs[0] = imgs[0][..., :3]
print('shape without alpha:    ', imgs[0].shape)
print('The data type of the first image is: ', imgs[0].dtype)

```
Here's a breakdown:

datagen.load_imgs_from_directory(directory="/content/drive/MyDrive/content/", filter='noisy*.png', dims='YXC'): This line uses the load_imgs_from_directory method of the datagen object to load all '.png' files from the specified directory. The filter parameter specifies that only files with names matching the pattern 'noisy*.png' should be loaded. The dims parameter indicates the desired dimensions of the images, where 'YXC' stands for the order of dimensions: Y (height), X (width), and C (channels).

print('shape of loaded images: ', imgs[0].shape): This line prints the shape of the first loaded image. The shape typically includes information about the height, width, and number of channels of the image.

imgs[0] = imgs[0][..., :3]: This line removes the fourth color channel (Alpha channel) from the first loaded image if it exists. It assumes that the images are in RGB format, and the alpha channel is not needed for the denoising task.

print('shape without alpha: ', imgs[0].shape): This line prints the shape of the first image after removing the Alpha channel.

print('The data type of the first image is: ', imgs[0].dtype): This line prints the data type of the first image. The data type represents how the pixel values are stored (e.g., as integers or floats).

This code is preparing your image data by loading images from a directory, checking and adjusting their format as needed.

```
print(len(imgs))
print(imgs[0].shape)
print(imgs[0].dtype)
```
It seems like we're interested in exploring the properties of the loaded images further. 

```
print(len(imgs))
print(imgs[0].shape)
print(imgs[0].dtype)
```
Here's what each line does:

print(len(imgs)): This line prints the number of images loaded. The len(imgs) will give you the count of images in the list imgs.

print(imgs[0].shape): This line prints the shape of the first image in the list. The shape typically includes information about the height, width, and number of channels of the image.

print(imgs[0].dtype): This line prints the data type of the pixel values in the first image. The data type represents how the pixel values are stored, such as integers (int) or floating-point numbers (float).

By running these lines, you're getting a better understanding of the characteristics of the loaded images, including their count, shape, and data type. 

```
# Let's look at the image.

plt.figure()
plt.imshow(imgs[0][0,:,:,:])
plt.show()
```
This part of your code is using matplotlib to visualize the first image in the list imgs. Let's break it down:

```
# Let's look at the image.
plt.figure()
plt.imshow(imgs[0][0, :, :, :])
plt.show()
```
Here's an explanation:

plt.figure(): This creates a new figure for your plot. A figure is the window in which your plot appears.

plt.imshow(imgs[0][0, :, :, :]): This line uses the imshow function from matplotlib.pyplot to display the image. imgs[0] represents the first image in the list, and [0, :, :, :] selects the first slice along the first dimension. This indexing may be necessary if the images are 4D (e.g., if they have a batch dimension). The imshow function is then used to visualize the selected slice.

plt.show(): This displays the figure with the image. The image will be shown in a separate window or inline, depending on your environment.

This code snippet is a quick way to visually inspect the first image in your dataset. If you have more images and you want to visualize them, you might consider using a loop or a grid layout to display multiple images. If you have any specific questions about the output.

```
patch_size = 64
```
It looks like we've set the variable patch_size to the value 64. This variable likely represents the size of patches that will be extracted from the images during the training or testing process.

For example, in the context of image processing or deep learning, you might be dividing your images into smaller patches (sub-images) of size 64x64 pixels. This is a common practice to train models on smaller parts of the images, allowing them to learn patterns and features more effectively.

If you use this patch_size later in your code, it may be involved in tasks such as data preprocessing, data augmentation, or specifying the input size for your neural network.


```
# Patches are extracted from all images and combined into a single numpy array

patch_shape = (patch_size,patch_size)
patches = datagen.generate_patches_from_list(imgs, shape=patch_shape)
```
It seems like we are generating patches from the loaded images using the generate_patches_from_list method of our datagen object. Let's break down the code:

```
# Patches are extracted from all images and combined into a single numpy array
patch_shape = (patch_size, patch_size)
patches = datagen.generate_patches_from_list(imgs, shape=patch_shape)
```
Here's an explanation:

patch_shape = (patch_size, patch_size): This line defines the shape of the patches you want to extract. In this case, it's a tuple (patch_size, patch_size). The patch_size variable, which you previously set to 64, determines the height and width of each patch.

patches = datagen.generate_patches_from_list(imgs, shape=patch_shape): This line uses the generate_patches_from_list method of your datagen object to extract patches from the list of images (imgs). The shape parameter specifies the desired shape for the patches, which you set using patch_shape. The resulting patches are combined into a single NumPy array, and they will likely be used for training or testing your deep learning model.

By generating patches, you are breaking down the images into smaller pieces, allowing your model to learn from more localized features and patterns.

```
Generated patches: (480, 64, 64, 3)
```
The output (480, 64, 64, 3) indicates the shape of the array containing the generated patches. Let's break down what each dimension represents:

480: This is the number of patches generated. In this case, you have 480 patches extracted from your input images.

64: This is the height of each patch. Each patch is a square, and its height is 64 pixels.

64: This is the width of each patch. Each patch is a square, and its width is 64 pixels.

3: This represents the number of color channels in each patch. Since it's 3, it suggests that the patches are in RGB format, where each pixel has red, green, and blue color channels.

So, overall, the shape (480, 64, 64, 3) tells you that you have 480 patches, and each patch has dimensions of 64x64 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).

These generated patches are likely to be used as training data for your denoising model.

```
# Patches are created so they do not overlap.
# (Note: this is not the case if you specify a number of patches. Refer the docstring for details!)
# Non-overlapping patches enable us to split them into a training and validation set.

train_val_split = int(patches.shape[0] * 0.8)
X = patches[:train_val_split]
X_val = patches[train_val_split:]
```
This part of your code is creating non-overlapping patches and splitting them into training and validation sets. Let's break down the code:

```
# Patches are created so they do not overlap.
# (Note: this is not the case if you specify a number of patches. Refer the docstring for details!)
# Non-overlapping patches enable us to split them into a training and validation set.

train_val_split = int(patches.shape[0] * 0.8)
X = patches[:train_val_split]
X_val = patches[train_val_split:]
```
Here's an explanation:

train_val_split = int(patches.shape[0] * 0.8): This line calculates the index at which you want to split your patches into training and validation sets. It takes 80% of the total number of patches (patches.shape[0]) for training. The int() function is used to ensure that the result is an integer.

X = patches[:train_val_split]: This line creates the training set (X) by taking the first train_val_split patches from the patches array.

X_val = patches[train_val_split:]: This line creates the validation set (X_val) by taking the remaining patches starting from the index specified by train_val_split.

By splitting the patches into training and validation sets, you're preparing your data for training a deep learning model. Training will be performed on the X set, and the performance of the model will be evaluated on the X_val set.

Certainly! Let's break down the line train_val_split = int(patches.shape[0] * 0.8) in more detail:

patches.shape[0]: This represents the number of patches in your dataset. The shape attribute of a NumPy array returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the array. In this case, shape[0] gives you the number of patches along the first dimension.

* 0.8: This multiplies the total number of patches by 0.8, which is 80%. This is a common practice to allocate 80% of the data for training.

int(...): This wraps the result in the int function, ensuring that the result is an integer. This is important because you can't have a fraction of a patch; you need a whole number to index into the array.

So, train_val_split is calculated as 80% of the total number of patches, and it represents the index at which you'll split your patches into training and validation sets. The remaining 20% of patches will be used for validation.

This approach is a common way to split datasets for training and validation in machine learning. The training set is used to train the model, and the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance on data it has not seen during training, helping to detect overfitting or other issues. 

```
# Let's look at two patches.
plt.figure(figsize=(14,7))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.imshow(X[0,...])
plt.title('Training Patch');
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.imshow(X_val[0,...])
plt.title('Validation Patch');
```
This part of your code is using matplotlib to visualize two patches, one from the training set (X) and one from the validation set (X_val). Let's break down the code:

```
# Let's look at two patches.
plt.figure(figsize=(14,7))
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.imshow(X[0,...])
plt.title('Training Patch');
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.imshow(X_val[0,...])
plt.title('Validation Patch');
```
Here's an explanation:

plt.figure(figsize=(14,7)): This line creates a new figure for your plot with a specified size. The figsize parameter sets the width and height of the figure in inches.

plt.subplot(1,2,1): This line creates a subplot grid with 1 row and 2 columns and selects the first subplot. The following plot commands will be applied to this subplot.

plt.imshow(X[0,...]): This line uses the imshow function to display the first patch from the training set (X). The ... is a shorthand to represent all the remaining dimensions after the first one.

plt.title('Training Patch'): This line adds a title to the first subplot indicating that it's a training patch.

plt.subplot(1,2,2): This line selects the second subplot in the grid for the upcoming plot.

plt.imshow(X_val[0,...]): This line uses imshow to display the first patch from the validation set (X_val).

plt.title('Validation Patch'): This line adds a title to the second subplot indicating that it's a validation patch.

plt.show(): This command displays the entire figure with both subplots.

This code snippet allows you to visually compare a training patch with a validation patch side by side. It's a good practice to inspect the data you're working with to get a sense of its characteristics.

```
# train_steps_per_epoch is set to (number of training patches)/(batch size), like this each training patch
# is shown once per epoch.

train_batch = 32
config = N2VConfig(X, unet_kern_size=3,
                   unet_n_first=64, unet_n_depth=3, train_steps_per_epoch=int(X.shape[0]/train_batch), train_epochs=20, train_loss='mse',
                   batch_norm=True, train_batch_size=train_batch, n2v_perc_pix=0.198, n2v_patch_shape=(patch_size, patch_size),
                   n2v_manipulator='uniform_withCP', n2v_neighborhood_radius=5, single_net_per_channel=False)

# Let's look at the parameters stored in the config-object.
vars(config)
```
This section of your code is setting up the configuration for training the N2V (Noise2Void) model. Let's break down the code:

```
# train_steps_per_epoch is set to (number of training patches)/(batch size), like this each training patch
# is shown once per epoch.

train_batch = 32
config = N2VConfig(X, unet_kern_size=3,
                   unet_n_first=64, unet_n_depth=3, train_steps_per_epoch=int(X.shape[0]/train_batch), train_epochs=20, train_loss='mse',
                   batch_norm=True, train_batch_size=train_batch, n2v_perc_pix=0.198, n2v_patch_shape=(patch_size, patch_size),
                   n2v_manipulator='uniform_withCP', n2v_neighborhood_radius=5, single_net_per_channel=False)

# Let's look at the parameters stored in the config-object.
vars(config)
```
Here's an explanation:

train_batch = 32: This sets the batch size for training to 32. The batch size represents the number of samples (patches, in this case) that will be processed together in each training step.

N2VConfig(...): This creates an instance of the N2VConfig class, which likely holds configuration parameters for the N2V model.

X: The training data (patches) is passed as an argument to N2VConfig.

unet_kern_size=3: This sets the kernel size for the U-Net architecture used in N2V to 3.

unet_n_first=64: This sets the number of filters in the first layer of the U-Net to 64.

unet_n_depth=3: This sets the depth of the U-Net to 3.

train_steps_per_epoch=int(X.shape[0]/train_batch): This sets the number of steps per epoch during training. It's calculated as the total number of training patches divided by the batch size, ensuring each patch is shown once per epoch.

train_epochs=20: This sets the number of training epochs to 20.

train_loss='mse': This sets the training loss function to mean squared error (MSE).

batch_norm=True: This enables batch normalization in the model.

train_batch_size=train_batch: This sets the training batch size to the previously defined value of 32.

n2v_perc_pix=0.198: This parameter controls the percentage of pixels to be manipulated during training.

n2v_patch_shape=(patch_size, patch_size): This sets the shape of the patches to be used during training.

n2v_manipulator='uniform_withCP': This likely sets the type of data manipulation to be performed during training.

n2v_neighborhood_radius=5: This parameter controls the radius of the neighborhood considered during training.

single_net_per_channel=False: This might indicate whether a single neural network is used for all channels.

vars(config): This prints the parameters stored in the config object.

This configuration is essential for setting up the training process for your N2V model.

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the configuration of your N2V model:

```
# train_steps_per_epoch is set to (number of training patches)/(batch size), like this each training patch
# is shown once per epoch.

train_batch = 32
config = N2VConfig(X, unet_kern_size=3,
                   unet_n_first=64, unet_n_depth=3, train_steps_per_epoch=int(X.shape[0]/train_batch), train_epochs=20, train_loss='mse',
                   batch_norm=True, train_batch_size=train_batch, n2v_perc_pix=0.198, n2v_patch_shape=(patch_size, patch_size),
                   n2v_manipulator='uniform_withCP', n2v_neighborhood_radius=5, single_net_per_channel=False)

```
Let's break down the key aspects of this configuration:

Data Configuration:

X: This represents your training data, which consists of patches extracted from images.
Architecture Configuration:

unet_kern_size=3: Sets the kernel size of the U-Net architecture to 3.
unet_n_first=64: Determines the number of filters in the first layer of the U-Net, set to 64.
unet_n_depth=3: Specifies the depth (number of layers) of the U-Net, set to 3.
Training Configuration:

train_steps_per_epoch: The number of training steps per epoch. It's set to ensure each training patch is shown once per epoch.
train_epochs=20: The number of training epochs, indicating how many times the entire dataset will be passed forward and backward through the neural network.
train_loss='mse': The loss function used during training, set to mean squared error (MSE).
batch_norm=True: Enables batch normalization, a technique that helps stabilize and accelerate the training of deep neural networks.
train_batch_size=train_batch: The number of samples (patches) in each batch during training, set to 32 in this case.
N2V-Specific Configuration:

n2v_perc_pix=0.198: This parameter controls the percentage of pixels to be manipulated during training.
n2v_patch_shape=(patch_size, patch_size): Sets the shape of the patches to be used during training.
n2v_manipulator='uniform_withCP': Specifies the type of data manipulation during training.
n2v_neighborhood_radius=5: Controls the radius of the neighborhood considered during training.
Channel Configuration:

single_net_per_channel=False: This parameter might indicate whether a single neural network is used for all channels (set to False), or separate networks are used for each channel.
This configuration provides a comprehensive setup for training your N2V model. It includes architectural choices, training parameters, and N2V-specific configurations. Adjusting these parameters can have a significant impact on the model's performance, and they are often fine-tuned based on the characteristics of the dataset and the specific task at hand.

```
# a name used to identify the model --> change this to something sensible!
model_name = 'n2v_2D_stars'

# the base directory in which our model will live
basedir = 'models'

# We are now creating our network model.
model = N2V(config, model_name, basedir=basedir)
```
In this part of your code, you're naming and creating an instance of the N2V model. Let's break down the code:


```
# a name used to identify the model --> change this to something sensible!
model_name = 'n2v_2D_stars'

# the base directory in which our model will live
basedir = 'models'

# We are now creating our network model.
model = N2V(config, model_name, basedir=basedir)
```
Here's an explanation:

model_name = 'n2v_2D_stars': This line sets a name for your model. It's a good practice to choose a name that reflects the nature or purpose of your model. In this case, it's named 'n2v_2D_stars'.

basedir = 'models': This line sets the base directory where your model will be saved. The model files, including weights and configuration, will be stored in the 'models' directory.

model = N2V(config, model_name, basedir=basedir): This line creates an instance of the N2V model. It takes three arguments:

config: The configuration you defined earlier, specifying various parameters for the model and training process.
model_name: The name you assigned to your model.
basedir: The base directory where your model will be saved.
This line effectively instantiates the N2V model with the provided configuration, and the model will be saved in the specified directory.


```
# We are ready to start training now.
history = model.train(X, X_val)
```
This line of code initiates the training process for your N2V model using the provided training and validation sets (X and X_val). Let's break it down:

```
# We are ready to start training now.
history = model.train(X, X_val)
```
Here's an explanation:

model.train(X, X_val): This method starts the training process for your N2V model. It takes two arguments:

X: The training set, which consists of patches extracted from your images.
X_val: The validation set, which consists of patches reserved for evaluating the model's performance during training.
history: The training process returns a history object, which typically contains information about the training and validation metrics across epochs. You can use this object to analyze the training progress, check for overfitting, and make decisions about further training or adjustments.

By running this line, your N2V model will start learning from the training data, and its performance will be evaluated on the validation set. The training process involves updating the model's weights based on the optimization algorithm and the specified loss function (mean squared error in this case).

```
print(sorted(list(history.history.keys())))
plt.figure(figsize=(16,5))
plot_history(history,['loss','val_loss']);
```
It looks like you are printing the available keys in the history.history dictionary and then plotting the training and validation loss over epochs. Let's break down the code:

```
print(sorted(list(history.history.keys())))

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 5))
plot_history(history, ['loss', 'val_loss'])
```
Here's an explanation:

print(sorted(list(history.history.keys()))): This line prints the sorted list of keys available in the history.history dictionary. These keys typically represent different metrics tracked during training and validation, such as training loss, validation loss, accuracy, etc.

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 5)): This line creates a new figure for your plot with a specified size. The figsize parameter sets the width and height of the figure in inches.

plot_history(history, ['loss', 'val_loss']): This line plots the training and validation loss over epochs. The plot_history function (likely from a library or custom code) is used to visualize the training history.

The first argument (history) is the object containing training history information.

The second argument (['loss', 'val_loss']) is a list specifying which metrics to plot. In this case, it's plotting both the training loss and the validation loss.

This code will provide you with a visual representation of how your model is performing during training and whether there are signs of overfitting or underfitting. If you have more specific questions about the output

```
what is epoch?
```
In the context of machine learning, an epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset during the training of a model. In other words, during one epoch, the model sees and learns from every example in the training dataset once.

During each epoch, the model's parameters (weights and biases) are updated based on the optimization algorithm and the specified loss function. The goal is to iteratively improve the model's ability to make predictions on the training data.

The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that you set before training your model. It determines how many times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. The choice of the number of epochs depends on the complexity of the problem, the size of the dataset, and other factors.

Typically, training a model involves running multiple epochs until the model converges to a satisfactory level of performance. However, it's essential to monitor training and validation performance during each epoch to detect issues such as overfitting (where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data) or underfitting (where the model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data).

In the code you provided earlier, train_epochs=20 suggests that the model will undergo 20 complete passes through the training dataset during the training process.

# We import all our dependencies.

from n2v.models import N2V
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.image import imread, imsave
from csbdeep.io import save_tiff_imagej_compatible
```
It looks like you are importing the necessary dependencies for a task involving denoising using Noise2Void (N2V). Let's break down the code:

```
# We import all our dependencies.

from n2v.models import N2V
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.image import imread, imsave
from csbdeep.io import save_tiff_imagej_compatible
```
Here's an explanation of each import:

from n2v.models import N2V: This line imports the Noise2Void (N2V) model class from the n2v.models module. The N2V class likely provides the implementation for the N2V denoising algorithm.

import numpy as np: This imports the NumPy library and aliases it as np. NumPy is a powerful library for numerical operations in Python and is commonly used in scientific computing and machine learning.

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt: This line imports the pyplot module from the matplotlib library and aliases it as plt. Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in Python, and pyplot provides a convenient interface for creating various types of plots.

from matplotlib.image import imread, imsave: This imports the imread and imsave functions from the matplotlib.image module. These functions are used for reading and saving images, respectively.

from csbdeep.io import save_tiff_imagej_compatible: This line imports the save_tiff_imagej_compatible function from the csbdeep.io module. This function is likely used to save TIFF images in a format compatible with ImageJ.

Overall, these imports suggest that you are working on a denoising task using Noise2Void and may involve reading, saving, and visualizing images using NumPy, Matplotlib, and other related libraries. 

```

# Here we denoise the image (predict)
# The parameter 'n_tiles' can be used if images are to big for the GPU memory.
# If we do not provide the n_tiles' parameter the system will automatically try to find an appropriate tiling.
# This can take longer.

pred = model.predict(img, axes='YXC')

```
This part of your code denoises an image using the trained Noise2Void (N2V) model. Let's break down the code:
```
# Here we denoise the image (predict)
# The parameter 'n_tiles' can be used if images are too big for the GPU memory.
# If we do not provide the 'n_tiles' parameter the system will automatically try to find an appropriate tiling.
# This can take longer.

pred = model.predict(img, axes='YXC')
```
Here's an explanation:

model.predict(img, axes='YXC'): This line uses the predict method of your N2V model to denoise an input image (img). The axes parameter specifies the order of dimensions in the input image. In this case, it's set to 'YXC', which typically means that the input image has dimensions for the Y-axis, X-axis, and color channels.

pred: The denoised image is stored in the variable pred. The result of the prediction is the denoised version of the input image based on what the model has learned during training.

'n_tiles' parameter: The comment in your code mentions that you can use the 'n_tiles' parameter if your images are too big for GPU memory. Specifying 'n_tiles' allows you to process the image in smaller tiles or chunks, which can be helpful when working with large images that might not fit entirely into GPU memory.

Automatic tiling: If you don't provide the 'n_tiles' parameter, the system will automatically try to find an appropriate tiling strategy. This may take longer as the system needs to determine an optimal tiling configuration based on available resources.

This code segment is a crucial step in applying your trained N2V model to denoise an image.
